            <p>Food is a basic necessity for survival and also the key to a healthy life. Without regular healthy meals children struggle to go to school, carers struggle to work and communities are left battling to survive.</p>

            <p>Without a proper home, it is very difficult or impossible for displaced families to find paid work. Many live in camps or informal settlements far from towns and markets, and can’t afford to travel. </p>

            <p>Family giving creates a bond, helping to bolster relationships through a shared goal and raising more money than could otherwise be possible through individual donations. Chances are, many of your family members are already giving to charity, so working together could help you to make even more of a positive impact.</p>
